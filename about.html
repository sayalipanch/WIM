            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Libraries are cornerstones of our communities as hubs for knowledge, research, history, and so much more. 
               They are places where people can connect with others and invest in their own future. We know that libraries
               are a huge resource to every community, but how about our online communities?
            </p><br>
            <p>Our library’s website isn’t just a website, it’s an entirely separate branch of the library system. As such, it’s
               important to give patrons an online experience with the same value as they would find walking through
               the doors of their local library. It should be clean, vibrant, and accessible to all. It should be a place where
               information and resources are easy to locate, with the newest and most popular things offered right up
               front. It should be a place that your patrons feel excited and happy to use. It’s more than a website, it’s your
               digital library branch.
            </p><br>
            <p>With that in mind, we’ve gathered some of our favorite library websites that showcase some of the best
               aspects of a great digital library branch. Below, you’ll see a roundup of some of the best websites in some of
